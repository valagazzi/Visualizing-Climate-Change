## Visualizing climate change

This project reviews climate change, demonstrating that human-produced greenhouse gases (GHGs) like CO2, CH4, and N2O are primary drivers of global warming. 
Utilizing data from sources such as Our World in Data and the IPCCâ€™s Sixth Assessment Report, we analyze emissions by country and per capita, highlighting 
the complexity of attributing responsibility. The study also identifies key emission sources, advocating for innovative methods to reduce emissions. 
Despite certain limitations, the findings underscore the collective responsibility in addressing this global challenge.

## How to run:

In order to properly run the code of the file, Python and Jupyter Notebooks are required. The file should be opened as a Jupyter Markdown. Moreover, 
the dataframes can be found in my personal website for download. Make sure to substitute the default paths when reading the excel files for your own ones.
Regarding the packages, the required ones are `pandas`, `numpy`, `matplotlib`, `seaborn`, and `pycountry`.

## Data sources

The data was taken from Our World in Data, that collects it from different sources. For more information, visit my webpage and download the article.
